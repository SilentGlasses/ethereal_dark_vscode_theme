# Ethereal Galaxy Theme for VS Code

Copy (or symlink) the generated package directory into the VS Code extensions directory:

```
cp -R 'VS Code/themer-my-color-set' ~/.vscode/extensions/
```

Then reload or restart VS Code.

The generated theme package should be in the list of installed extensions, and "Themer My Color Set Dark" / "Themer My Color Set Light" will be available in the list of themes.
