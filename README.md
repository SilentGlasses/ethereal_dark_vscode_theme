# Ethereal Galaxy Theme for VS Code

Copy (or symlink) the package directory into the VS Code extensions directory:

```
cp -R 'ethereal_galaxy_vscode_theme' ~/.vscode/extensions/
```

Then reload or restart VS Code.

The generated theme package should be in the list of installed extensions, and "Ethereal Galaxy Theme Dark" / "Ethereal Galaxy Theme Light" will be available in the list of themes.
